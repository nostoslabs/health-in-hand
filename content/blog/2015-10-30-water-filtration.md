We'll explore a two-part issue associated with water: proper filtration as well as hydration. We're going to look at these two issues separately and together. Let's start with filtration.

In my work as a Naturopathic Doctor and EDS (Electro-Dermal Screening) homeopathic technician, I see a great deal of toxic foci associated with municipal water even when filtered. This has become an area of focus for me since water is such a big part of who we are!

## The Importance of Water

Consider these statistics about water in our bodies:

- We are **99% water** in the womb
- **90% water** at birth
- **70-75% water** throughout most of our lives
- About **50% water** in the years just before death

Given these numbers, the quality of water we consume has a profound impact on our overall health.

## Water Contamination Concerns

Modern water supplies face contamination from numerous sources:

- **Pharmaceutical drugs** (prescription and over-the-counter)
- **Recreational drugs**
- **Chemical compounds**
- **Pesticides**
- **Herbicides**
- **Vaccine residues**

These contaminants can pass through standard water treatment facilities and end up in our drinking water, even in homes with basic filtration systems.

## NSF Standard 401 Certification

In March 2015, the NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) introduced Standard 401 Certification. This new standard specifically tests water filters for their ability to remove:

- Prescription drugs
- Over-the-counter medications
- Herbicides
- Pesticides
- Various chemical compounds

This certification represents a significant step forward in water filtration standards, addressing modern contamination concerns that previous standards didn't cover.

## Recommended Water Filtration

The Multipure filter systems, particularly the **Aquaperform** model, are among the few filters that meet NSF Standard 401 certification. These filters provide:

- Comprehensive contaminant removal
- NSF-certified performance
- Long filter life (600-900 gallon capacity)
- Reliable protection against modern water contaminants

## Looking Ahead

As the saying goes: "Wars have been fought over oil and land, but in the future, wars will be fought over clean water."

Ensuring access to properly filtered, clean water is not just a health concernâ€”it's becoming one of the most critical issues of our time.
