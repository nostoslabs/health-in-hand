Homeopathy is built on the principle of "like cures like". It has also been referred to as "similar suffering". This means an illness can be treated by a substance capable of producing similar symptoms to those being suffered by the patient.

An example of this is treating poison oak with the homeopathic remedy Rhus Toxicodendron (homeopathic poison oak). This works because the energy frequency of poison oak is stronger than the molecular structure of poison oak.

## Historical Background

Homeopathy's roots trace back to Hippocrates (460-370 BC), who believed:

- A person's symptoms hold the key to their needed remedy
- The body is capable of healing itself
- Natural causes and environmental factors are important

Hippocrates challenged the prevailing "Law of Contraries", which suggested treating conditions with opposite substances.

## Development of Homeopathy

The practice was developed by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), a German medical doctor who was frustrated with the medical practices of his era. Through extensive experimentation with substances like quinine, Hahnemann discovered that:

- Substances causing specific symptoms could potentially cure those same symptoms
- Diluting remedies through "dilution and succussion" made them less physically aggressive but more energetically potent

## Understanding Homeopathic Remedies

Homeopathy can be defined as "energy frequency with memory, minus the molecular structure of its former shape." This means that the remedies work on an energetic level rather than a chemical one.

Through the process of dilution and succussion, homeopathic remedies become:
- Less aggressive physically
- More aggressive energetically
- Capable of addressing the body's energetic imbalances

Future articles will explore the "symptom picture" and the detailed dilution process in greater depth.
